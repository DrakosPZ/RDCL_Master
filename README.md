	<h2>This tools purpose.</h2>
	<p>This collection of tools has been written for my personal use, and made public to make it easier for new Camera and Lighting Artists to safe time with repetitve parts of setting up and post producing scenes, which don't have access to large inhouse libaries managing those elements.</p>
	<p>Because of that these libraries are primarily setup for myself and to work with my workflow. </p>
	<p>If someone else finds usage in what I have written for myself, feel free to use it and where possible and appropriate credit me in a small way.</p>
	<p>I do not promise to keep these libraries up to date, relevant or improve on them in any major way, but if someone finds any bugs, or has ideas on how to improve the tools, throw them somewhere here and if there is enough traction I'll see what can be donen.</p>
